1.Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
	- SOA or Service Oriented Architecture is an enterprise level approach when it comes to developing an application in which 
	it utilizes the sustainable software components or services such as checking customer’s debit and signing into the website.

2.List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
	- Standardized Service Contracts – it is a service that has a well-defined set of guidelines to ensure that it follows the similar 
	guidelines to maintain their service contracts to express their purpose, and capabilities.

	- Loose Coupling – it reduces the dependency on each service, and every modification on one component should not greatly affect the 
	other services.

	- Abstraction – it hides unnecessary information of services, metadata, or data in the external view so that clients can only focus 
	on the main functionality of the service. It also plays a major part in the positioning and service composition designs.

	- Service Reusability – it is developing a service that can be reused in various business or organizations process.

	- Autonomy – services that can operate their logic independently despite external influences.

	- Statelessness – A service that does not store data and utilizes minimal usage of resources to achieve the scalability and 
	improvement of reusable services.

	- Discoverability – Service contract provides the necessary metadata for clients to easily discover the purpose and capabilities 
	of the service. 

	- Composability – It breaks down big problems into smaller pieces of an existing services that enables them work together easily by 
	promoting the reusability and adaptability.

	Interoperability – it is most considered in this generation that it is typically rejected as a principle. It sets a standard which 
	allows users to gain access to the service that it provides.
3.Define Microservices.
	- Microservices is an architectural style approach that is used to develop an independent software and is similar to SOA. 
	It is called microservice because it is made up of independent services that enables them to provide more scalable, resilient, 
	and sustainable application. 
4.List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
	- Independently deployable – it plays significant role in the characteristics of microservices since it has the ability 
	deploy individual microservices independently using network, enhancing the overall productivity of the organization.

	- Right tool for the job - It helps the organization to choose the appropriate tools, application, and framework that is suitable 
	for their tasks. Implementing multiple, smaller services allows the organization to boost their productivity and is more cost efficient.

	- Precise scaling – it has the ability individually deploy services individually and can also be scaled individually. 
	It enhances the productivity, and it will be cost efficient because it will only scale the required components precisely rather than the entire application.
5.List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
	*Similarities:
	Reuse – In SOA, it develops a new service that can be recycled in different system which reduces the agility and resilience of an application. 
	Microservice usually prefer to copy and duplicate the data by recycling the codes.

	Synchronous Calls – Services in SOA uses predominantly synchronous protocols like APIs to reuse the available services in the enterprise. 
	Microservices implements real-time dependencies which can affect the performance and cause them a loss of resilience and latency.

	Data Duplication – They will both occur if there is a similar data that is stored in various services within the system. They are both performs a specific function.
	*Difference:
	Communication – Microservices is independently developed and has their own communication protocol. SOA mainly focuses on sharing common communication 
	mechanism in their service which is known as the Enterprise Service Bus.

	Interoperability – Microservice utilizes lightweight messaging protocols, While SOA has a standard set which allows the user to gain access to the service.

	Service Granularity – services in SOA have a small range but can provide a specialize services in enterprise-wide services. While Microservice is 
	mainly designed to accomplish a single task but is made up of highly specialized services.

	Speed – SOA has the ability to simplify in development and troubleshooting, but the operation of SOA will takes more time than microservice since 
	both SOA and Microservice shares a common architecture.
